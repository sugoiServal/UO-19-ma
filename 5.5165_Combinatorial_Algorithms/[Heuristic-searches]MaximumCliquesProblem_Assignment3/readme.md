# Heuristic Algorithms to solve Maximum Clique Problem
we designed four `Heuristic Algorithms` to solve the `Maximum cliques Problem`, that includes:
- hill-climbing algorithm
- simulated annealing algorithm
- tabu search algorithm
-  genetic algorithm

### in `Report.pdf`, there are
- the problem formulation
- algorithm designs to these four algorithms
- experimental result

### in `run.py`, there are implementation to
- hill-climbing
- simulated annealing
