## Generate `Signed Permutation`
- A `signed permutation` is a permutation with optional signs attached to the elements; therefore,
there are $2^nn!$ such signed permutations of n element.
### We design and implement an algorithm that generates all signed permutations of 1, 2, ..., n where each step either interchanges two adjacent elements or negates the first element
