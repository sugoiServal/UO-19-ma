""" This file is a part of the VeRyPy classical vehicle routing problem
heuristic library and provides an implementation of the (parametrized)
sequential savings heuristic of Webb (1964). In contrast to the more
popular parallel savings heuristic the sequential version build the routes one
at the time.

The script is callable and can be used as a standalone solver for TSPLIB
formatted CVRPs. It has minimal dependencies: only numpy and scipy are
required to be installed for reading and preparing the problem instance."""

    Implementation of the Webb (1964) sequential savings algorithm /
    construciton heuristic for capaciated vehicle routing problems with
    symmetric distances.
    
    This is the sequential route version, which builds the solution one route 
    at the time by making always the best possible merge for that active route.
    
    It has been implemented as separate function from the parallel version, 
    because their working principle and datastrucutres differ significantly.
    
    The parameters are mostly the same as in parallel_savings.py:
    
    * D is a numpy ndarray (or equvalent) of the full 2D distance matrix.
    * d is a list of demands. d[0] should be 0.0 as it is the depot.
    * C is the capacity constraint limit for the identical vehicles.
    * L is the optional constraint for the maximum route length/cost/duration.
    
    * minimize_K sets the primary optimization objective. If set to True, it is
       the minimum number of routes. If set to False (default) the algorithm 
       optimizes for the mimimum solution/routing cost. In savings algorithms 
       this is done by ignoring negative savings values.
    
    * optional savings_callback is a function of the signature
        sorted([(s_i1,x_i1,i,j_1)...(s_ij,x_ij,i,j)...(s_in,x_in,i,n) ]) =
            savings_callback(unrouted, i, D)
      where the returned (sorted!) list contains savings s_ij (that is, how
       much route cost approximately decreases if a merge with an edge (i,j)
       is done). The x_ij is a secondary sorting criterion and it is ignored 
       by the savings heuristic. Note that the signature is different to the 
       parallel version  as the savings calculation is done only for the
       currently unrouted  customers and for customer i. 
      The default is a the Clarke Wright savings criterion.
