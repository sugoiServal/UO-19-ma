- This is a pytorch implementation of VAE, GAN and WGAN over the MNIST and CIFAR 10 data
sets to generate images. 

- We logged the training behavior of the models – the losses or distances against
the training iteration.  

- Also, we evaluated the impact of two hyper-parameters,
the models’ complexity and the latent space dimension, to the quality of generated image.
